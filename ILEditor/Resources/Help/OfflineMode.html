    <h3>Offline Mode in ILEditor</h3>
    <p>As of ILEditor 1.1.1.0, there has been an offline mode available so you can still work on your code while you're on the go.</p>
    <p>To use offline mode, start ILEditor and tick 'Offline Mode' before selecting your configuration.</p>

    <h3>Accessing a library offline</h3>
    <p>To access an existing library in offline mode, use the SPF Clone tool from the Source->Local Copies dropdown. This will download all sources from a remote library onto your local machine for offline mode.</p>

    <h3>Pushing your offline work back to your IBM i</h3>
    <p>When you start ILEditor in normal mode after using offline mode, you will be asked if you'd like to open the SPF Tool to push your local changes back up to IBM i.</p>
    <p>ILEditor will keep a list of files you've changed since you last did a push to IBM i (including when in offline mode), so it will only tick members which have been changed since your last push.</p>
